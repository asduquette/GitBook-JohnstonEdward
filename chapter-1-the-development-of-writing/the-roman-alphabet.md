# The Roman Alphabet

### THE ROMAN ALPHABET

The Alphabet, as we know it, begins with the ROMAN CAPITALS 5 \(see fig. 2\). Their fine monumental forms were evolved by the use of the chisel—probably under the influence of writing—and had reached full development about 2000 years ago \(see Plates [I.](../plates/plate-i.md), [II.](../plates/plate-ii-alphabet-from-trajan-inscription.md), and Chapter XV.\).

### Formal Writing

_FORMAL WRITING_—the “_book-hand_” or professional writing of the scribes—comes of the careful writing of the Roman Capitals \(see also _footnote_, p. [38](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47089/47089-h/47089-h.htm#p038), on the beginnings of fine penmanship\). It was the—“_literary hand_, used in the production of exactly written MSS., and therefore a hand of comparatively limited use. By its side, and of course of far more extensive and general use, was the _cursive hand_ of the time”[6](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47089/47089-h/47089-h.htm#footnote_6)[\[p037\]](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47089/47089-h/47089-h.htm#pageindex)

In early _cursive writing_—the running-hand or ordinary writing of the people—

Here it is sufficient to trace the history of the _formal_ Latin “hands,” but the continual, modifying influence exerted on them by the ordinary _cursive_ writing should be borne in mind. Notable results of this influence are seen in _Half-Uncials_ and _Italics_.
