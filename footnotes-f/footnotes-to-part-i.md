5 “The alphabet which we use at the present day has been traced back, in all its essential forms, to the ancient hieratic writing of Egypt of about the twenty-fifth century before Christ. It is directly derived from the Roman alphabet; the Roman, from a local form of the Greek; the Greek, from the Phœnician; the Phœnician, from the Egyptian hieratic. . . . We may without exaggeration . . . carry back the invention of Egyptian writing to six or seven thousand years before Christ.”—_Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, “Greek and Latin Palæography,”_ pp. 1–2.

8 It is possible that their forms were influenced by the use of the brush in painting up public notices and the like. The introduction of the use of vellum—a perfect writing material—in the making of books, led to such a great advance in the formality and finish of the book-hands \(especially of the Uncial character\) that, practically, it may be said to mark the beginning of _penmanship_ as a “fine” art. This change may be assigned to any time between the first and the third centuries \(palæographical dates before the fifth century must generally be regarded as approximate\).
