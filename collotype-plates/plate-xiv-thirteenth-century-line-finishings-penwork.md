**PLATE XIV**_._—Thirteenth-century Line-finishings: Pen-work. \(Psalter\). Brit. Museum, Royal MS. 1. D. x.

**THE LINE-FINISHINGS** \(see p. 205\), of which there are very many throughout the book, all in red or blue pen-work, are very varied. Nine kinds are shown in the plate \(which represents about a quarter of a page\), and three others from the same MS. are given in figs. 87 \(_b_\) and 126 \(_f_, _g_\).

The directions of the thick and thin strokes indicate a pen held at right angles to its usual position \(almost “upside down,” in fact: see fig. 126, _g_\), and the penmanship exhibits great speed and lightness of hand—the rapidity and skill are indeed quite remarkable \(_e.g._ in the Lion in the eighth line\).

Note that, though the writing occasionally runs into the margin, the line-finishings stop at the marginal-line.

The photograph shows red _dark_ and blue _light_: _e.g._ the Bird is red, the Lion and the Fish are blue. The fifth Line-finishing is a red filigree with blue “berries”—it can hardly be described as a “floral growth,” as the “branching” is reversed: the rubricator gained speed and uniformity by the simple repetition of the whorls all along the line—the upper branches were probably put in afterwards, and the “berries” were added later when he was making the _blue_ Line-finishings.

The more complex decoration \(not shown in the plate\) in this MS. is inferior to the penmanship: the small _background_ Capitals with which the verses begin—presumably put in by a different hand—are more pretentious, and do not match the Line-finishings.

_General Note._—When a space occurs at the end of a line of writing, it is often best to leave it, and in a plain MS., if it be “well and truly” written, there is no objection to varying lengths of line \(see pp. 263, 371\). But a book, such as a _Psalter_, divided into many short verses—in which the last line usually falls short of the marginal \[p426\]line—offers a fair field for such simple and effective decoration. \(See also pp. 428, 486, fig. 130, and [Plate XXIII](untitled.md).\)
