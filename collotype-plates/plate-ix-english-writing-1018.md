WRITING.—A very beautiful pointed \(slanted-pen\) Uncial. The “pointed” character of the letters, which yet retain their typical roundness, give this writing a peculiar charm. Note the top of the P has a marked angle, and the M and H, and even the O, have this slightly or strongly.

RULING.—Single lines, rather wide \(p. 305\).

ARRANGEMENT.—Certain of the lines are indented one letter \(p. 264\).

LARGE LETTERS.—On verso Col marking a “Chapter” is built-up in red, on recto the three large letters \(marking sections\) are simply written with the text pen \(p. 299\). \(The passage is S. John xi. 46–56.\)
